This is a client-side rendered WebApp for the [ubiqutious-octo-pancake](https://github.com/Capgemini-AIE/ubiquitous-octo-pancake) project.

It allows you to interact with the bot in an interactive chat window and on an administrative UI allows you to configure the conversation flow of the bot.

## Notes

_Please note, we're not snapshot testing the high level `App` component as there is an error when rendering the BotFramework `Chat` component._
